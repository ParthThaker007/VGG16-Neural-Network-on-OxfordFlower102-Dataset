# VGG16-Neural-Network-on-OxfordFlower102-Dataset
I implemented VGG16 CNN (Convolution Neural Network) on Oxford102Flower Dataset
Introduction:
The purpose of this project review is to assess the implementation and performance of the VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture on the Oxford102 dataset. The VGG16 model is widely recognized for its effectiveness in image classification tasks, making it a suitable choice for this project. The Oxford102 dataset consists of 102 categories of flowers, making it a challenging dataset for image classification tasks.

Project Overview:
The project aimed to utilize the VGG16 architecture to classify images from the Oxford102 dataset accurately. The key objectives of the project included data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation of the model's performance using various metrics such as accuracy<img width="652" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-17 194009" src="https://github.com/ParthThaker007/VGG16-Neural-Network-on-OxfordFlower102-Dataset/assets/101121538/58318be5-76dc-4627-9a78-d2a5feff1f67">
